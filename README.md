# Hi there, I'm Simon Danielsson 👋

Data Scientist at **BCG X** in Stockholm, tackling real-world problems with AI and ML. With former intern experience at LinkedIn and Ericsson as an ML Engineer, I am excited about the latest progress in NLP and ML more broadly - both from a foundational and application POV.

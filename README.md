# Hi there, I'm Simon ðŸ‘‹

Data Scientist at **BCG X** in Stockholm, tackling real-world problems with AI and ML. With former ML Engineering experience at **LinkedIn** and Ericsson, I am excited about the latest progress in NLP and ML more broadly - both from a foundational and application POV.

##  What I Enjoy

- **NLP & ML Engineering:** reading, learning, and contributing to anything related to NLP and ML. I contribute to the Hugging Face ecosystem and GitHubâ€™s official MCP server. I love designing tools that empower developers and researchers.
- **GenAI Web Apps:** building demo-driven, interactive apps to showcase AI models in action.
- **Neovim:** learning new ways to configure and use my favorite editor, as well as writing plugins.
